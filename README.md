# CS105-Final-Project

How to run the jupyter notebook:
(These following steps are optional. They are used for sampling a subset from the 50,000 review dataset)
1. Unzip the aclImdb file 
2. Create a folder named "Project Datasets"
3. Create two subfolders inside "Project Datasets" called "pos" and "neg"
4. Now you can run the first two code snippets of the jupyter notebook

If you skipped the steps for recreating the sample, you will just need to unzip the "Project Datasets.zip" file 

5. Now you should be able to run the rest of the jupyter notebook file.
6. Note that you shouldn't rerun the first two code snippets unless you have emptied the "pos" and "neg" subfolders of "Project Datasets". This will resample the reviews and mess up the 2,500 file split in each folder.
